Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass was a client who realized there was a lack of training for the DMV driving test and wanted to create a system that would allow people to have extra training and practice with the test. They wanted to set up a three tiered system of training amounts and course access. 

What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job of making sure to keep my language clear and non-technical which is important when it comes to presenting to clients and stake holders what you are doing with a task and how it will work. It also helps so the client and stake holders can make tweaks to the design and system before the actual work starts. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise my systems document and work on my UML diagrams some more. A lot of them had certain details and standards that weren't completely correct and could benefit from having a bit more work done so they are as clear as possible for industry standards. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Interpreting the user's needs, for me, is best done in steps. It's good to identify the needs that are functional and non-functional requirements and making sure it will be implemented well. If you don't implement the user's needs and wishes, then you product is going to fail. It's also important to consider the user's needs when designing things because you want to have a functional piece of work that makes users happy to use your system. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I like to approach it in pieces. It's nice to section off pieces of the client's needs and desires and work on the pieces before putting it together as a whole. Being able to create documentation and UMLs for use is extremely helpful so I will be using those in the future not only for myself to be able to look back on, but also for others to use when they want to review things for their own projects.
